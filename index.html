Texopic typesetting language 
</h1><p>
Texopic is a typesetting language for civilized, and less civilized ages. It is easy to learn and easy to use.
</p><pre>#title Your story here

Opening paragraph.

#href {https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.org&#x2F;}
{Example link}</pre><p>
The core principle in Texopic is to stay on the back when the author concentrates on writing her content. 
</p><p>
Texopic uses only one meta-character (#) to form macros. This makes it likely to avoid triggering a document processor when writing your plaintext. 
</p><p>
To make it even harder to trigger a macro by accident, the macro character and word must be separated from the plaintext by either semicolons or space. The surrounding semicolon characters around a macro word are consumed.
</p><pre>Hello#world</pre><p>
Would print out as &#x27;Hello#world&#x27;, whereas.
</p><pre>Hello;#world</pre><p>
Would trigger a macro #world right after the &#x27;Hello&#x27;. If you actually wanted to type &#x27;Hello #world&#x27; instead, you could add semicolon after the meta-character to prevent it from forming a macro.
</p><pre>Hello #;world</pre><p>
It should be extremely unlikely occurrence that a Texopic processor recognizes a macro from something you write or paste into your document. 
</p><p>
Every Texopic processor recognize the same macros and the same structure. Users can define new macro words to extend what they can do with the language. 
</p><p>
Texopic processor can be extended by writing new, custom processors with a scripting language such as <a href="https://python.org/">Python</a>.

1. Specification  <a href="#1" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><p>
Overall, this document here should describe the Texopic format in whole. 
</p><p>
If the tool doesn&#x27;t behave according to this document, the tool contains a bug.
</p><h2 id="tools">

<a href="https://github.com/cheery/texopic">Utility library for python</a> <a href="https://github.com/cheery/texopic/archive/master.zip">(Download)</a>
</p><h3 id="2.1">
2.1. Notes for utility library  <a href="#2.1" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
The library contains a module and scripts to generate html from Texopic format. That generator has been written in such way that lets you build your own document processor from the pieces. 
</p><p>
The html generator doesn&#x27;t escape HTML properly. That needs to be fixed later on. 
</p><p>
The repository for the utility library contains also the most up-to-date version of this document.
</p><h2 id="3">
3. Character escapes  <a href="#3" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><p>
Texopic processors are expected to accept UTF-8 text. But they can also recognize two forms of character escapes: #XX and #U+XXXX. You can use both of these formats to represent unicode characters that mess up in the editor.
</p><h2 id="4">
4. Macro block ##  <a href="#4" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><p>
Sometimes it is desirable to not let Texopic format your text. For example when writing short code snippets, or something that should go through a specialized processor that doesn&#x27;t obey Texopic rules. 
</p><p>
For this purpose there is a ## macro. When ## appears on the end of a line, it will consume the subsequent lines that are indented higher than the line where the ## macro appeared.
</p><pre>#code python ##
    print(&quot;hello world&quot;)</pre><p>
This feature may make Texopic pain-in-the-ass to syntax color. But then it enables you to write a real, backwards compatible WYSIWYG text processor around this format. 
</p><p>
The semicolon after a ## macro prevents it from having an effect at the end of a line.
</p><h2 id="5">
5. Blank lines  <a href="#5" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><p>
Blank lines in Texopic text are interpreted as implicit macros. This is interpreted as a start of a new paragraph. 
</p><p>
Macros can be used to discard an empty paragraph and start a segment of text with special meaning. #title, #section; and #subsection all have precisely that behavior.
</p><h2 id="6">
6. Macro grouping  <a href="#6" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><p>
The { and } characters are used to group in Texopic. 
</p><p>
} and { characters can be used in the stream without worries as long as they pair properly inside the macro groups. They only have meaning when they come after a macro. 
</p><p>
Whenever a macro is followed by one or more groups, those groups are fused into the macro as arguments. 
</p><p>
Blank lines or characters between a macro and a group prevent the macro from collecting the group. 
</p><p>
Here are several examples of groups that do not fuse with a macro:
</p><pre>#href;{does not fuse}

#url

{does not fuse}</pre><p>
These groups fuse with macros preceding them:
</p><pre>#href{&#x2F;&#x2F;example.org}{example}

#href {&#x2F;&#x2F;example.org} {example}

#href
{&#x2F;&#x2F;example.org}
{example}</pre><p>
Macros have to be explicit before macro grouping applies to them. Grouping is not done on the implicitly created macros at line breaks.
</p><h2 id="7">
7. Macro resolution  <a href="#7" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><p>
To understand how Texopic document is processed it is accurate to think of it as a chain of functions. 
</p><p>
The first function transforms plaintext input into sequence of characters and macro words. Lines consumed by ## token are annotated to it. The newlines followed by blanks, and macros followed by &#x27;;&#x27; are marked. 
</p><p>
The second function forms segments from a sequence produced by the first function. The groups and macros are formed and no further parsing is necessary after that point. 
</p><p>
At this point the control is up to the user. She can choose which kind of output she wants. She can completely customize how the macros are interpreted by adjusting the output processors.
</p><h3 id="7.1">
7.1. Default processor behavior  <a href="#7.1" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
There is a default behavior for how outputting processor should work.
</p><ul><li>
It should maintain a buffer for the current text segment.
</li><li>
It should manage to create a new vertical list and a buffer for a group or for a list itemization.
</li><li>
Inside macro groups it should be allowed to ignore implicit macros and other such commands that cause the vertical list to grow.
</li><li>
It should trim whitespace out of the start and end of a paragraphs and refuse to produce empty paragraphs.
</li><li>
It should not output empty paragraphs.
</li></ul><h2 id="8">
8. Recognized macros  <a href="#8" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><p>
This is a quick summary of what is recognized by the <a href="https://github.com/cheery/texopic">Texopic html processor</a>.
</p><pre>#title

#end{enumerate}
#item
#end
#comment
#begin{comment}
#end{comment}</pre><p>
The macros try to follow conventions present in LaTeX. 
</p><p>
Additionally, on HTML output you have a #css -macro, you can use it like this:
</p><pre>#css ##
    body { padding: 0; margin: 0; }</pre><h2 id="9">
9. URL handling  <a href="#9" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><p>
URLs in Texopic should be prefixed with #url macro word. The automatic recognition of URLs is impractical to solve in such way that it covers any and every valid URL you could pass into the text.
</p><h2 id="10">
10. History  <a href="#10" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><p>
Texopic started out during an <a href="//github.com/cheery/lever/blob/master/documentation_considerations.tex">assessment</a> of TeX for documentation in <a href="//leverlanguage.com">Lever</a>. 
</p><p>
For Lever I wanted reference documentation to be written outside of the source files. The code would be annotated to refer on the reference, rather than the other way around. 
</p><p>
Lever documentation flows upwards from the source code. This means that aside from reference, there is internal documentation that is sectioned by source files. That internal documentation is currently in text files, which felt very natural to write. I plan to section internal documentation into chapters that still are sectioned by source files. This internal documentation forms the basis for higher layers of documentation. 
</p><p>
I prefer that the references, guides and all the other material would be available on the website as well as in the runtime. To do this I need a format that a documentation system in runtime could layout directly, and that could be translated into highly linked, high quality HTML files. 
</p><p>
Many of the files designed for this purpose was unclear and it was hard to figure out what kind of notation they use. They appeared to be also difficult to customize. 
</p><p>
With Texopic I can completely customize my documentation generation.
</p><h2 id="11">
11. Trivia  <a href="#11" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><p>
While inspired by TeX, Texopic is neither TeX nor a superset of TeX. 
</p><p>
Texopic name born as a wordplay from &quot;TeX by Topic&quot;. Author thinks it sounds a bit like Aztec. 
</p><p>
A small python script, texopic.py was the first instance of a readable typesetting format that could be used to documentation that matches to high standards. Later on, it became the <a href="//github.com/cheery/texopic/blob/master/texopic2html.py">texopic2html.py</a> 
</p><p>
