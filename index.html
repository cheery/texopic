<h1>
Texopic typesetting format
</h1><p>
Texopic is a side-effect of designing
<a href="https://leverlanguage.com">https://leverlanguage.com</a>. It is easy to learn and
easy to use typesetting format for civilized, and less
civilized ages.
</p><p>
While highly inspired by TeX, Texopic is neither TeX nor a
superset of TeX.
</p><p>
Texopic name born as a wordplay from "TeX by Topic". Author
thinks it sounds a bit like Aztec.
</p><p>
Core principle in texopic is the use of one control
character (#) to form macros. This makes it easy to avoid
triggering a document processor when writing a plaintext.
</p><p>
To make it even harder to trigger a macro on accident, the
macro word must be separated from plaintext by either
semicolons or space. The surrounding semicolon characters
around a macro word are consumed.
</p><p>
It should be extremely unlikely occurrence that texopic
processor recognizes a macro from an URL you paste into your
document.
</p><p>
Whenever a macro is recognised, every texopic processor
recognizes the exact same macros and structure.
</p><h2 id="1">
1.  Character escapes
 <a class="ref" href="#1">$</a>
</h2><p>
Texopic processors are expected to accept UTF-8 text. But
they can also recognize two forms of character escapes:
#XX and #U+XXXX. You can use both of these formats to
represent unicode characters that mess up in the editor.
</p><h2 id="2">
2.  Macro block ##
 <a class="ref" href="#2">$</a>
</h2><p>
Sometimes it is desirable to not let texopic format your
text. For example when writing short code snippets, or
something that should go through a specialized processor
that doesn't obey texopic rules.
</p><p>
For this purpose there is a ## macro. When ## appears
on the end of a line, it will consume the subsequent lines
that are indented higher than the line where the ## macro
appeared.
</p><p>
<pre>#code python ##
    print("hello world")</pre>
</p><p>
This feature may make texopic pain-in-the-ass to syntax
color. But then it enables you to write a real, backwards
compatible WYSIWYG text processor around this format.
</p><p>
The semicolon after a ## macro prevents it from having an
effect at the end of a line.
</p><h2 id="3">
3.  Segment breaking
 <a class="ref" href="#3">$</a>
</h2><p>
Blank lines in texopic text breaks the text into segments.
Also, the ## macro always ends a segment.
</p><p>
Macros can be used to label a segment to give them a special
meaning. #title, #section and #subsection have precisely
that behavior.
</p><h2 id="4">
4.  Macro grouping
 <a class="ref" href="#4">$</a>
</h2><p>
The { and } characters are used to group in texopic. They
prevent newlines from breaking the segment.
</p><p>
} and { characters can be used in the stream without worries
as long as they pair properly inside the macro groups. They
only have meaning when they come after a macro.
</p><p>
Whenever a macro is followed by one or more groups, those
groups are fused into the macro as arguments.
</p><p>
Blank lines or characters between a macro and a group
prevent the macro from collecting the group.
</p><p>
Here are several examples of groups that do not fuse with a
macro:
</p><p>
<pre>#href;{does not fuse}

#url

{does not fuse}</pre>
</p><p>
These groups fuse with macros preceding them:
</p><p>
<pre>#href{//example.org}{example}

#href {//example.org} {example}

#href
{//example.org}
{example}</pre>
</p><h2 id="5">
5.  Macro resolution
 <a class="ref" href="#5">$</a>
</h2><p>
To understand how texopic works through the document. It is
accurate to think of it as a chain of functions.
</p><p>
The first function transforms plaintext input into sequence
of characters and macro words. Lines consumed by ## token
are annotated into that token. The newlines followed by
blanks and macros followed by ';' are marked.
</p><p>
The second function forms segments from a sequence produced
by the first function. The groups and macros are formed and
no further parsing is needed after that point.
</p><p>
At this point the control is on the user. She can choose
which kind of output he wants. She can completely customize
how the macros are interpreted by adjusting the output
processors.

6.  Recognized macros
 <a class="ref" href="#6">$</a>
</h2><p>
This is a quick summary of what is recognized by the
experimental texopic html processor at
<a href="https://github.com/cheery/texopic">https://github.com/cheery/texopic</a>.
</p><p>
<pre>#title
##
#url{domain}
#href{domain}{description}
#section
#subsection</pre>
</p><p>
The macros try to follow conventions present in LaTeX.
</p><h2 id="7">
7.  URL handling
 <a class="ref" href="#7">$</a>
</h2><p>
URLs in texopic should be prefixed with #url macro word.
The automatic recognition of URLs is extremely hard problem
to solve in such way that it covers any and every valid URL
you could pass into the text.
</p><h2 id="8">
8.  Notes
 <a class="ref" href="#8">$</a>
</h2><p>
Overall, this is a description of a format. This document
should describe the texopic format in whole.
</p><p>
The document is accompanied by scripts to generate html in
the repository. You can use them to create your own texopic
document processors. Those scripts do not define the format
though.

9.  History
 <a class="ref" href="#9">$</a>
</h2><p>
Texopic started as
<a href="//github.com/cheery/lever/blob/master/documentation_considerations.tex">consideration</a> of using TeX for documentation in
<a href="//leverlanguage.com">Lever</a>.
</p><p>
For Lever I wanted that reference documentation would be
written outside of the source files. The code would be
annotated to refer on the reference, rather than the other
way around.
</p><p>
Lever documentation flows upwards from the source code. This
means that aside reference, there is internal documentation
that is sectioned by source files. That internal
documentation is currently in text files, which felt very
natural to write. I plan to section internal documentation
into chapters that still are sectioned by source files. This
internal documentation forms the basis for higher layers of
documentation.
</p><p>
I prefer that the references, guides and all the other
material would be available on the website as well as in the
runtime. To do this I need a format that a documentation
system in runtime could layout directly, and that could be
translated into highly linked, high quality HTML files.
</p><p>
Many of the files designed for this purpose was unclear and
it was hard to figure out what kind of notation they use.
They appeared to be also difficult to customize.
</p><p>
With texopic I can completely customize my documentation
generation.
</p><p>
A small python script,
<a href="//github.com/cheery/texopic/blob/master/texopic.py">texopic.py</a>,
was the first instance of a readable typesetting format that
could be used to documentation that matches to high standards.
