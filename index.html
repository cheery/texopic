Texopic is a typesetting language for civilized, and less civilized
ages. It is easy to learn and easy to use.
</p><p>Here is a sample of the Texopic markup:</p><pre>

<a href="//leverlanguage.com">Lever language</a> has a library utility
for handling texopic files.
</p><h2 id="2">2. Specification <a href="#2" class="ref">$</a></h2><p>
Texopic is an UTF-8 encoded plain text markup and typesetting
language.
</p><h3 id="2.1">2.1. Macro syntax <a href="#2.1" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
A macro starts with a hash character (#). It is immediately followed
by the name and arguments closed into braces ({ and }).
</p><pre>#name{arg1}{arg2}</pre><p>
The name of a macro must not contain spaces or semicolon
&#x27;;&#x27;, otherwise the macro can be spaced apart and even broken
into newlines as long as there is not a blank line between the
arguments.
</p><pre>#name
{arg1} {arg2}</pre><p>
Macro requires that there is blank or one of the &#x27;{&#x27;,
&#x27;}&#x27; or &#x27;;&#x27; before the hash character (#). The
following sequences do not form macros:
</p><pre>(#test {macro})
hello#bold{some text}</pre><p>
The semicolon &#x27;;&#x27; can be used to start or terminate a macro.
In these cases the macro consumes the semicolon and it is not
displayed in the output. Here are some examples of the use:
</p><pre>hello-;#bold{in-middle-of}-word
test;#3A;character
#a{b}; {c}
</pre><p>
If you want a semicolon after a macro, then type two semicolons.
</p><h3 id="2.2">2.2. Use of braces <a href="#2.2" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Braces &#x27;{&#x27; and &#x27;}&#x27; can be freely used as long as
they are not inside macro arguments. In the macro arguments they are
allowed but are also required to pair.
</p><h3 id="2.3">
2.3. Preformatted text blocks <a href="#2.3" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
To not let Texopic format text, for example when writing short code
snippets or embed something in JSON, you can use the ## -macro. When
the ## appears on the end of a line it will consume the subsequent
blank lines and the lines that are indented higher than the line where
the ## appeared on. Here are few short examples:
</p><pre>
#code python ##
    print(&quot;hello world&quot;)

#meta ##
    {&quot;language&quot;: &quot;en&quot;,
     &quot;flavor&quot;: &quot;article&quot;,
     
     &quot;day&quot;: &quot;18.3.2017&quot;}
</pre><p>
Preformatted text block cannot appear inside a macro argument and it
terminates any macro.
</p><h3 id="2.4">
2.4. Paragraph breaks <a href="#2.4" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Blank line only consisting of spaces forms a paragraph break.
Similarly to the preformatted text block it cannot appear inside
macros as arguments and it also terminates all macros.
</p><p>
The lack of preformatted text blocks and paragraphs breaks inside
macros makes the language easier to interpret by removing several
annoying, ugly and rare fringe cases. It also allows to terminate the
missing brace syntax errors early on.
</p><h3 id="2.5">
2.5. Verbatim or canonical form <a href="#2.5" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Texopic forms are canonicalized upon parsing. The canonicalization
does the following:
</p><ul>
<li>The newlines not forming paragraph breaks are rewritten as spaces.
</li><li>Multiple consecutive spaces are collapsed into single space.
</li>
</ul><p>
Such verbatim is retrieved as a string and it is used whenever a macro
argument must be interpreted as a variable or link resource.
</p><h3 id="2.6">2.6. Segments <a href="#2.6" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Top-down, the Texopic document consists of segments, groups and pre
-blocks.
</p><p>
Segment is a line of text. The segment may be tagged with a macro. For
example:
</p><pre>#title Title text</pre><p>
If a segment is not tagged then it is a paragraph. A tagged segment
may capture a preformatted block.
</p><h3 id="2.7">2.7. Groups <a href="#2.7" class="ref">$</a></h3><p>
Group is a larger macro constructs, it has a marker for begin and end,
and one or more separators between it. Example:
</p><pre>
#begin{enumerate}
First item.
#item
Second item.
#item
Third item.
#end
</pre><p>
The begin may contain one or more arguments and it will be reformatted
into a pseudo-macro. For example the above #begin{enumerate} turns
into #enumerate.
</p><p>
The end marker may be either implicit (#end) or explicit
(#end{enumerate}). The explicit form is favored if the group spans
more than 10 lines.
</p><h3 id="2.8">2.8. Environments <a href="#2.8" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
The above descriptions of a segment and a group do not describe which
macros form segments or groups. For this purpose we have environment
descriptions.
</p><p>
Environment description describes which rules our macros should
follow. Here&#x27;s an example of one written in json:
</p><pre>
{
    &quot;segments&quot;: {
        &quot;title&#x2F;0&quot;:   {&quot;capture&quot;: false},
        &quot;section&#x2F;0&quot;: {&quot;capture&quot;: false},
        &quot;section&#x2F;1&quot;: {&quot;capture&quot;: false}
    },
    &quot;groups&quot;: {
        &quot;itemize&#x2F;0&quot;:   {&quot;separators&quot;: [&quot;item&#x2F;0&quot;]},
        &quot;enumerate&#x2F;0&quot;: {&quot;separators&quot;: [&quot;item&#x2F;0&quot;]}
    }
}
</pre><p>
The description may eventually also describe how the elements are
layouted.
</p><h3 id="2.9">2.9. Explicit form <a href="#2.9" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
I foresee that someone may want to use explicit forms. I may even
personally want to eliminate implicit interpretations later on from
the language. Therefore I provide some forward-compatible measures
now.
</p><pre>
#:title Write your title here

The first paragraph.

#href{https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.org}{An example link}

#:section Fruit list

#begin{enumerate}
#.item Orange
#.item Banana
#.item Watermelon
#end{enumerate}

#!code python ##
    print(&quot;hello&quot;)
</pre><p>
The symbols &#x27;:&#x27;, &#x27;.&#x27;, &#x27;!&#x27; starting a
name provide explicit cue to how the macro should be treated. The
&#x27;:&#x27; tells a start of an ordinary segment. The &#x27;!&#x27;
tells that the segment captures a preformatted block. The
&#x27;.&#x27; tells that the macro is a separator.
</p><p>
I expect that the use of the Texopic format will be always slightly
use-specific.
</p><h3 id="2.10">
2.10. Character escapes <a href="#2.10" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Texopic processors are expected to accept UTF-8 text. But they can
also recognize two forms of character escape macros: #XX and #U+XXXX.
You can use both of these formats to represent unicode characters that
mess up in the editor.
</p><h3 id="2.11">2.11. URL handling <a href="#2.11" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
URLs in Texopic should be prefixed with #url macro word. The automatic
recognition of URLs is impractical to solve in such way that it covers
any and every valid URL you could pass into the text.
</p><h3 id="2.12">
2.12. Recognized macros <a href="#2.12" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
This is a quick summary of what is recognized by the <a
  href="https://github.com/cheery/texopic">Texopic html processor</a>.

</pre><p>The macros try to follow conventions present in LaTeX.</p><p>
Additionally, on HTML output you have a #css -macro, you can use it
like this:

    body { padding: 0; margin: 0; }


</pre><h2
  id="3">3. Attained design objectives <a href="#3" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><h3 id="3.1">
3.1. Supports writer&#x27;s workflow <a href="#3.1" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Stays on the back when the author concentrates on writing her
document. The author only needs to worry about use of one
meta-character (#) while working on the text.
</p><h3 id="3.2">
3.2. Can be generated <a href="#3.2" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Documents can be modified &amp; generated by computer. This comes
useful if you have to maintain up-to-date programming language
documentation or publish a report that is based on data collected by
computers.
</p><h3 id="3.3">
3.3. Interoperable with other formats <a href="#3.3" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Can embed other plaintext files inside itself. Can reference to
directory files or hyperlink to external resources.
</p><h3 id="3.4">
3.4. Supports direct rendering to the screen <a
  href="#3.4"
  class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Has a clean structure when loaded to computer&#x27;s memory. Can be
used directly to print on the screen. Conversion to other formats is
not needed.
</p><h3 id="3.5">
3.5. Supports WYSIWYG software <a href="#3.5" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Supports plaintext editing but doesn&#x27;t enforce you to it. A
WYSIWYG editor can be written over the markup.
</p><h3 id="3.6">3.6. Tolerant <a href="#3.6" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Formatting errors are marked into the output and do not interrupt the
parsing. Missing a brace has only a local effect that does not mess up
the whole representation of a file.
</p><h3 id="3.7">3.7. Extensible <a href="#3.7" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Can be extended to support additional structure. There is a standard
method to build a generator which makes it straightforward to
implement new generators or extensions.
</p><h2 id="4">
4. Comparison with similar languages <a href="#4" class="ref">$</a>
</h2><h3 id="4.1">4.1. XML &amp; HTML <a href="#4.1" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
XML &amp; HTML formats share the closest resemblence and have similar
goals. They have more fringe cases and are harder to work with. These
formats attempt to be general and are therefore flawed in all of the
usecases they have. Texopic is not suitable for replacing XML in all
of its usecases, but should work better for written documents.
</p><h3 id="4.2">4.2. TeX <a href="#4.2" class="ref">$</a></h3><p>
TeX formed inspiration for Texopic. The limitations are that TeX
interpreter can get triggered from about any character and because of
how it is constructed you cannot expect a text processing tool to read
a TeX file and then write it back.
</p><h3 id="4.3">4.3. Markdown <a href="#4.3" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
Markdown is a bullettin-board format that has ended up to wide use
everywhere. It has a focus on readability. Markdown can be extended
but extensions easily become complex and interact unfavorably with
other extensions. Markdown only translates well to HTML.
</p><h3 id="4.4">
4.4. reStructuredText <a href="#4.4" class="ref">$</a>
</h3><p>
reStructuredText is Python language&#x27;s documentation format. It
has lot of similarities to Markdown format although it is slightly
better thought out. Where XML &amp; HTML are too generic, the
reStructuredText and Markdown are too specific. This limits what you
do with them.
</p><h2 id="5">5. History <a href="#5" class="ref">$</a></h2><p>
Texopic started out during an <a
  href="//github.com/cheery/lever/blob/master/documentation_considerations.tex">
assessment
</a> of TeX for documentation in <a href="//leverlanguage.com">Lever
</a>.
</p><p>
For Lever I wanted reference documentation to be written outside of
the source files. The code would be annotated to refer on the
reference, rather than the other way around.
</p><p>
Lever documentation flows upwards from the source code. This means
that aside from reference, there is internal documentation that is
sectioned by source files. That internal documentation is currently in
text files, which felt very natural to write. I plan to section
internal documentation into chapters that still are sectioned by
source files. This internal documentation forms the basis for higher
layers of documentation.
</p><p>
I prefer that the references, guides and all the other material would
be available on the website as well as in the runtime. To do this I
need a format that a documentation system in runtime could layout
directly, and that could be translated into highly linked, high
quality HTML files.
</p><p>
Many of the files designed for this purpose was unclear and it was
hard to figure out what kind of notation they use. They appeared to be
also difficult to customize.
</p><p>
With Texopic I can completely customize my documentation generation.
</p><h2 id="6">6. Trivia <a href="#6" class="ref">$</a></h2><p>
While inspired by TeX, Texopic is neither TeX nor a superset of TeX.
</p><p>
Texopic name born as a wordplay from &quot;TeX by Topic&quot;. Author
thinks it sounds a bit like Aztec.
</p><p>
A small python script, texopic.py was the first instance of a readable
typesetting format that could be used to documentation that matches to
high standards. Later on, it became the <a
